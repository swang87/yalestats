# Typesetting Equations {#typeset-equ}

## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read \LaTeX\ code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section.


$$\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq {{\beta_i^2}\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}}
\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + {\delta_i^2\beta_i^2\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
$$

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx
$$

Another equation:

$$\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
\end{matrix}\right|>0$$

The \noindent command below does what you'd expect:  it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. This was done here to match the format of the LaTeX thesis PDF.

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: $x^2$

\noindent Subscript: $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$

\noindent Both combined: $x_1^{k+1}$.

## Statistics Symbols and Expressions

\noindent Our favorite Greeks: $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, $\mu$

\noindent Defining a normally distributed random variable: $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma)$

How do we compute sample variance again?

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}$$

Sometimes  you'll need to consider asymptotics, that is, what happens as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
