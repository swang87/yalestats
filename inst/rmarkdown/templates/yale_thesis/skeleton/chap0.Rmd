# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ comprehensive evaluation report template. For illustration purposes, the template uses multiple chapters and sections. You should modify this setup based on your own needs. We recommend that you retain the following sections:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction/Background
3. Data
4. Analysis
4. Conclusion
5. Appendix
6. References

## Notes about the Appendix

We highly recommend that lengthy chunks in the code should be pushed to the appendix. Note that you will not need to retype code chunks in full in the appendix. You just have to refer to them by name. See the bottom of `conclusion.Rmd` for details on this.

## Notes about References

We use BibTeX for references here. By default, the BibTeX file used lies in `bib/thesis.bib`. You should take a look at this file to get a sense for the structure of BibTeX references. You can export citations in BibTeX form from Google Scholar, for example. 

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.  One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard \LaTeX\ requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  


If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file.  You can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

### Tips

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept \LaTeX\ markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
